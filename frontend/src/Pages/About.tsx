                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                   I put on skates at age 4, memorized my multiplication tables using hockey card stats by 10, captained a state championship team by 18,
                    and earned a computer science degree from Tufts University by 22. Now a professional software engineer, this site is the culmination
                    of a lifelong passion for both hockey and statistics.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    Built with React and FastAPI, this app demonstrates full-stack development with live API integration, modern
                    styling, and responsive design. Whether you're a developer, a hockey fan, or both â€” I hope that you enjoy it!
